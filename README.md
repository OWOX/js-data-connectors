![JavaScript Open-Source Connectors](res/main-cover.png)
## Why
We believe that everyone should have easy access to data. That‚Äôs why we are introducing open-source data connectors to empower every business to become data owners by importing their data into Spreadsheets or data warehouses.
Although there are many great SaaS and open-source products available, we see the need for a solution that offers a free cloud version and doesn‚Äôt require data engineers for maintenance.

## What
With just a few clicks and no coding, you can easily set up automated data imports into your spreadsheets and earn the following benefits:
- **Security-Friendly**: Being open-source, no credentials need to be shared with third-party products.
- **Unlimited Customization**: Scheduling and data schemas can be adjusted at any time.
- **Streamlined Tech Stack**: Connectors can be developed and customized via Apps Script. Google Sheets is more than enough to run your own data pipelines
- **Free**: The Connectors are distributed under MIT license and the Core functionality is distributed under ELv2 license, it allows free use for internal organizational services or providing paid services to clients, as long as it is not used to build a competing product.
- **Serverless**: neither Google Cloud nor computing resources are required to run it
