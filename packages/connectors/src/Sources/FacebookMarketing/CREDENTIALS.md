## Step 5: Grant API Permissions

Grant the required token permissions:

- `ads_read`  
- `read_insights`  

   These permissions authorize your app to access advertising data from your Facebook account.

## Step 7: Use the Access Token

Once you have the access token, you can begin using it as described in the [Getting Started guide](GETTING_STARTED.md).

If you encounter API limit errors or see the message: **"Ad account owner has NOT granted ads_management or ads_read permission"**, it likely means your app is still operating with Standard Access.
To resolve this, youâ€™ll need to:

1. Switch your app to **Live Mode**
2. Request **Advanced Access** for the following permissions:

- `ads_read`
- **Ads Management Standard Access**

## Step 8: Request Advanced Access for Ads Management

1. Go to the **App Review â†’ Permissions and Features** tab.
2. Locate **Ads Management Standard Access**.
3. If the access level is set to **Standard Access**, click **Request Advanced Access**.

![Facebook Request Access](res/facebook_standard_access.png)

Click the **Next** button.

![Facebook Next](res/facebook_next.png)

On the next screen, click **Go to Verification** and complete the required fields.

![Facebook Verification](res/facebook_ver.png)

Describe in detail how your application will use Ads Management functionality.

**Example:**

> _We are requesting Advanced Access to the Facebook API to support our internal data analytics operations. Our application's core function is to retrieve high-volume advertising cost and performance data from our company's ad accounts for detailed ROI analysis and financial reconciliation._
>
> _Standard API limits would significantly restrict our ability to collect the comprehensive historical and daily data essential for this process. Advanced Access is required to ensure a continuous and reliable data flow for our analytical models._
>
> _Our technical workflow utilizes the OWOX Data Mart connector to retrieve this information from the Facebook API. The data is then loaded directly into our Google BigQuery (GBQ) data warehouse, where it is used for internal analysis only. This application operates exclusively with our proprietary data._

  â†’ Select **No**

  â†’ Select **No**

After completing all required fields, click the **Submit for Review** button.

Meta will review your request, and you will be notified once itâ€™s approved.

## Step 9: Verify API Permissions and App Status

To ensure your Facebook app is properly configured for the Ads API, complete the following checks:

Navigate to the **Marketing API â†’ Settings** tab and confirm that the **Ads API Access Level** is set to **Standard**.

![Facebook Standard](res/fb_standard.png)

Go to **App Review â†’ Permissions and Features**.

- Locate the `ads_read` permission and ensure it has either **Standard Access** or **Advanced Access**.  
  Both access types are supported.

![Facebook ads_read](res/fb_adsread.png)

- Scroll to **Ads Management Standard Access** and confirm that it is set to **Advanced Access**.

Ensure that your app is set to **Live** mode (not in Development mode).  
Only live apps can be used for real API calls.
