1. **Make sure Node.js â‰¥ 22.16.0 is installed**

   If you don't have it installed, [download it here](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
   (Windows / macOS / Linux installers are all listed there)

   > **Tip:** To avoid potential permission issues (`sudo`), consider using a Node Version Manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for macOS/Linux or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) for Windows.
   > **Note**: If you encounter any installation issues, check the [Ñ–ssue](https://github.com/OWOX/owox-data-marts/issues/274).

2. **Open your terminal** and run **one** command

   ```bash
   npm install -g owox
   ```

   (You'll see a list of added packages. Some warns are possible â€” just ignore them.)

3. **Start OWOX Data Marts** locally

   ```bash
   owox serve
   ```

   (Expected output:
   ðŸš€ Starting OWOX Data Marts...
   ðŸ“¦ Starting server on port 3000...)

4. **Open** your browser at **<http://localhost:3000>** and explore! ðŸŽ‰
