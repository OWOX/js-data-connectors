  More Friendly and Consistent Forms

  We‚Äôve improved the interface to make working with forms in OWOX Data Marts more intuitive and user-friendly.
  - Unified form layout. All forms ‚Äî for Triggers, Reports, Storage, and Destinations ‚Äî now share a consistent design. This makes it easier to navigate and work with confidence.
  - Helpful hints where you need them. Tooltips and inline descriptions have been added next to form fields, so you can better understand what‚Äôs expected without second-guessing.

  - Faster editing. You can now enter edit mode in the Storage and Destinations tables with a single click on a row ‚Äî no need to hunt for buttons.
  - Warnings before leaving with unsaved changes. If you make changes to a Storage or Destination and try to leave without saving, you‚Äôll see a confirmation dialog ‚Äî helping prevent accidental data loss.
