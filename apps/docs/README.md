# OWOX Docs

This is source code for monorepo documentation site based on [Astro + Starlight][https://starlight.astro.build/] project.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of OWOX Docs project (`apps/docs` from monorepo root), you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ env-config.mjs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sync-docs.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ content.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

## ðŸš€ How it works

As you see in project structure there is difference between standart Starlight projects. All content is dynamical synced from all monorepo, and copied to the content (`src/content/docs/`) and assets (`src/assets/`) directories with dev and build commands. Also, you can manually initiate content updating process by sync command.

Then Starlight framework looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the content directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images are founded in `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory. They are not dynamically synced.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

You can run commands from the different directories of monorepo.
