# Enhanced Output Schema Formatting

The Output Schema has received a major upgrade to improve control over data readability in Destinations.

- Added support for column header descriptions as cell notes in the Google Sheets Destination, so you can define metrics everyone is aligned on
- Implemented automatic formatting for BigQuery and Athena timestamp fields
- Introduced the ability to control the order of fields delivered from Data Mart to Destination via simple drag & drop in the Output Schema
