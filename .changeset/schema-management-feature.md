Add data mart schema management feature that allows users to view, edit, and manage the structure of their data marts. This feature provides:

- Visual schema editor for both BigQuery and Athena data marts
- Ability to add, remove, and reorder fields in the schema
- Support for defining field types, modes, and other properties
- Schema validation to ensure compatibility with the underlying data storage
- Ability to actualize schema from the data source to keep it in sync

This enhancement gives users more control over their data mart structure and improves the data modeling experience.
