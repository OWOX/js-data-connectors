# UX/UI Improvements

## Add Planned Data Storages with "Coming Soon" Status

- Snowflake  
- Databricks  
- AWS Redshift  
- Azure Synapse  

## UI Updates: Triggers Table and Reports Table

- **Minor UI updates** to the Triggers Table  
- **UI improvements** to the Reports Table for consistency  

## More Friendly and Consistent Forms

We’ve improved the interface to make working with forms in OWOX Data Marts more intuitive and user-friendly.

- **Unified form layout**. All forms — for Triggers, Reports, Storage, and Destinations — now share a consistent design. This makes it easier to navigate and work with confidence.  
- **Helpful hints where you need them**. Tooltips and inline descriptions have been added next to form fields, so you can better understand what’s expected without second-guessing.  
- **Improved tooltip styling**. Tooltips now feature a more noticeable background, making important information easier to spot.  
- **Faster editing**. You can now enter edit mode in the Storage and Destinations tables with a single click on a row — no need to hunt for buttons.  
- **Warnings before leaving with unsaved changes**. If you make changes to a Storage or Destination and try to leave without saving, you’ll see a confirmation dialog — helping prevent accidental data loss.  

## Refined Data Mart Page: Layout, Menu, and Texts

- **Updated** the layout of the Connector block  
- **Polished** the dropdown menu on the Data Mart page  

## Redesigned "Create Data Mart" Page

The form on the Create Data Mart page has been updated for visual consistency and a better user experience.

## Extra Visual and Text Tweaks

We’ve also made a few small improvements to the UI and copy to make everything feel more polished and cohesive.
