# Add data mart run history feature that allows users to view and track execution history of their data marts. This feature provides

- New "Run History" tab in the data mart details view
- Comprehensive run history display with pagination support
- Real-time tracking of data mart execution status and results
- Load more functionality for viewing extensive run history
- Integration with existing data mart context and state management

Additional improvements include:

- Enhanced connector runner with better config handling for non-string values
- Improved AWS Athena storage with optimized query execution and DDL handling
- UI refinements including conditional chevron display in list item cards
- Cleanup of unused connector-related code from data storage features

This enhancement improves monitoring capabilities and gives users better visibility into their data mart execution patterns and performance.
