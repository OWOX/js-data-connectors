# Connector Trigger

Use this trigger type when you want to automatically import fresh data from a platform API on a regular schedule and update the [connector-based data marts](connector-data-mart.md).

## When to Use

Set up a `Connector Run` trigger if:

- You're using a [Connector-Based Data Mart](connector-data-mart.md)
- You want to refresh data ingestion into your warehouse automatically, without manual runs
- You want to control how frequently data is re-imported

## How to configure

1. Go to the **Triggers** tab of your Data Mart  
2. Click **+ Add Trigger**  
3. Select **Trigger Type** â†’ `Connector Run`  
4. Choose the schedule type:
   - **Daily** â†’ Set time of day and time zone
   - **Weekly** â†’ Pick days of the week, time, and time zone
   - **Monthly** â†’ Choose dates, time, and time zone
   - **Interval** â†’ e.g. every 15 minutes  
5. Click **Save**

You can return anytime to update, pause, or delete the trigger.  
You can also add **multiple triggers** for the same Data Mart to refresh multiple reports.
