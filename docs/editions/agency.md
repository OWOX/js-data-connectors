## Why We Built This

Running a successful agency means growing your client base ‚Äì but most existing marketing analytics tools for agencies punish you for growth. And that leads to an exponential SaaS subscription cost.

In addition, agencies often face the following challenges:

- Each client has its **own set of ad platforms** & sales CRM.
- Data analysts rewrite SQL queries and **build new dashboards from scratch** for every client.
- **Data privacy concerns**: you can't get permission to provide the client's credentials to 3rd-party data vendors.
- Lack of control over reporting logic, and each client waits for their own custom metrics.
- Data blending challenges ‚Äì one extra column needed means three more tasks to handle.
- Analytics bandwidth is a bottleneck ‚Äì reporting slows down when key people are out.

OWOX Data Marts Community Edition already gets you mostly covered. But the **Agency Edition** is designed specifically for reporting to multiple clients with:

- multiple projects
- advanced access control
- full logging
- conversational UI

It empowers agencies to automate all client analytics & reports delivery without reinventing the wheel.

## What You Can Do with OWOX Data Marts ‚Äì Agency Edition

### Power Your Clients' Data Marts

Bring together client data from various ad platforms, CRMs, or financial systems and turn it into **business-ready Data Marts**, ready for reporting. With no limits on # of data sources, data marts, or refreshing schedule, you can:

- Combine data from multiple sources under one roof and build **a single source of truth** for each client.
- Reuse your **logic** across multiple client projects.
- **Avoid SaaS limitations and cost-scaling**.

### Organize Data for Scalable Reporting

Define a **semantic layer** for each client project, ensuring that KPIs and metrics are consistent across reports:

- Set relationships between data marts.
- Build **multi-source data marts** from multiple platforms and tables using SQL.
- Keep logic **centralized and reusable**.

This approach allows agencies to **scale operations efficiently** and onboard new clients quickly without starting from scratch.

### Enable Self-Service Reporting for Clients

Automate data delivery from 3rd party platforms or corporate DWH to reports, giving clients access to **trusted, pre-defined data marts** using:

- Google Sheets;
